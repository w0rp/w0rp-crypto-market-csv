# w0rp-crypto-market-csv

This repository hosts a script I run to get market data on coins to figure out
what the exchange rates are on various exchanges. You can install it with
`yarn`, and you can run it to print market data as CSV to stdout with
`./get-csv.sh`.

Don't run it too often, or you'll hit rate limits.
